    "sage_gpt_analysis": "It seems like you're looking for a comparison of the content of text messages exchanged during dating versus marriage. While I don't have the exact percentages, I can help highlight some common themes and changes in communication style that might reflect the differences between texting while dating and texting while married.\n\n### Content of Text Messages While Dating vs. Married\n\n#### Common Texts During Dating:\n- **Casual Greetings:** \"Hey\" (high occurrence)\n- **Affectionate Terms:** \"Love\" (common as a term of endearment)\n- **Excitement Signals:** Emojis or exclamations (e.g., \"Can't wait to see you!\")\n- **Planning:** Texts about meeting up or dates (e.g., \"What time are we meeting?\")\n- **Personal Touch:** Frequent use of each other's names\n\n#### Common Texts While Married:\n- **Practical Communication:** \"Home,\" \"Dinner,\" \"Ok\" (frequent use of practical language)\n- **Household Topics:** Discussions about chores, errands, and family matters (e.g., \"Did you pick up milk?\")\n- **Familiarity:** Use of abbreviations or shorthand, like \"u\" instead of \"you\"\n- **Less Formal Affection:** May see less direct use of \"love\" or more inside jokes and references specific to the couple\n- **Efficient Communication:** Simpler, more to-the-point messages focused on logistics or daily life\n\n### Summary of Changes:\n- **Affectionate expressions may decrease** in quantity but shift to more implied forms of love and partnership.\n- **Practical, daily life topics** are likely to increase as communication becomes more focused on shared responsibilities and family life.\n- **Casual greetings** might remain but could feel more routine than when dating.\n\nThis framework can vary widely depending on the individuals in the relationship, and it may also depend on the stage of marriage and other contextual factors."
